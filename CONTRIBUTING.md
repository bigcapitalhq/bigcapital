## Contribute to Backend

- Clone the `bigcapital` repository and `cd` into `bigcapital` directory.
- Install all npm dependencies of the monorepo, you don't have to change directory to the `backend` package. just hit these command on root directory and it will install dependencies of all packages.

```
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

- Run all required docker containers in the development, we already configured all containers under `docker-compose.yml`.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait some seconds, and hit `docker-compose ps` and you should see the same result below.

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                               NAMES
d974edfab9df   bigcapital-mysql   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   7 seconds ago   Up 1 second   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   bigcapital-mysql-1
cefa73fe2881   bigcapital-redis   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   7 seconds ago   Up 1 second   6379/tcp                            bigcapital-redis-1
1ea059198cb4   bigcapital-mongo   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   7 seconds ago   Up 1 second   0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp            bigcapital-mongo-1
```

- There're some CLI commands we should run before running the server like database migration, so we need to build the `server` app first.

```
npm run build:server
```

- Run the database migration for system database.

```
node packages/server/build/commands.js system:migrate:latest
```

And you should get something like that.

```
Batch 1 run: 6 migrations
```

- Next, start the webapp application.

```
npm run dev:server
```
